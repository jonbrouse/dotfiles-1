### Credits ###

- [James Tomasino](https://github.com/jamestomasino/dotfiles): James is my original inspiration for creating my own set of dotfiles, but also to become more efficient in the command line over the years.
- [Zach Holman](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles): For a great breakdown of why to have your dotfiles topic centric.
- [Dries Vints](https://github.com/driesvints/dotfiles): Dries's Brewfile was the original draw/inspiration for mine, and then I expanded based on his influences and others that I've come across over time.
- [Maxime Fabre](https://github.com/Anahkiasen/dotfiles): A verbose setup of OSX configurations.
