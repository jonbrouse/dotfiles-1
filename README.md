## Dotfiles

----
### What is this?

Dotfiles are configuration files in Unix systems that start with a dot (think of *.gitignore*). The preceeding "dot" is an indication for normal users that these files are not regular documents, and by default are hidden in directory listings.

### Why is it useful?

You can set up a new system using dotfiles and an installation script in minutes. It's not hard to get started with your own repository, but I would recommend checking out some [existing projects](https://dotfiles.github.io/). Read through the setups, the reasonings for each configuration and some of that project's inspirations. There is a lot to learn along this road. For me, this truly was more about the journey than the destination.

### How do I use it?    
1. Clone the repo
2. Run install.sh

- [James Tomasino](https://github.com/jamestomasino/dotfiles): James is my original inspiration for creating my own set of dotfiles, but also to become more efficient in the command line over the years.
- [Zach Holman](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles): For a great breakdown of why to have your dotfiles topic centric.
- [Dries Vints](https://github.com/driesvints/dotfiles): Dries's Brewfile was the original draw/inspiration for mine, and then I expanded based on his influences and others that I've come across over time. *Although I've since removed the Brewfile from my setup, a lot of the learnings I gained from Dries was transferred to what I've currently ended up with.*
